[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/odin3/Avi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/odin3/Avi)

Application that allows to watch movies online from any Android device.

## How it works
This application uses internal KinoPoisk API to search, identify and collect data about the movie.
To watch movies, I use [moonwalk.co](http://moonwalk.co/the_api) service that hosts movies and TV shows.
Received Kinopoisk ID from movie used to get player's URL for the movie from Moonwalk.

## Requirements
* Android 4.2+
* Network connection
