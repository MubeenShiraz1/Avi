Application that allows to watch movies online from any Android device.


## How it works
This application uses [unofficial KinoPoisk API](http://kinopoisk.cf) to search, identify and collect data about the movie.
To watch movies, I use [moonwalk.co](http://moonwalk.co/the_api) service that hosts movies.
Received Kinopoisk ID from movie used to get player's URL for the movie from Moonwalk.

## Requirements
* Android 4.4+
* Network connection
* 1GHz CPU
* 1Gb RAM (Recommended)

## Disclaimer
1. This application is still in active development phase and not production ready yet.
2. Author doesn't take responsibillity for the video content. All data is hosted and provided by Moonwalk.
